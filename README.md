AME 535a Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics

Simulation of a channel flow. Designed a mathematical model for a Hagenâ€“Poiseuille flow using pseudo-transient, fractional step methods consisting of Adams-Bashforth method, Neumann boundary conditions, and Crank-Nicolson scheme. Compared stability of fluid and computational costs using various Reynolds number. Discussed the effect of Reynolds number on Navier-stokes' viscous terms. Code outputs produce the vertical profiles and centerline for the velocity components, flow rate, and RMS error prediction for velocity and flow rate along the channel.
